## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Overview
---
In this project, we will use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) as sample dataset.
