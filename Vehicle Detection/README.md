# **Vehicle Detection**

In this project, our goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4).


The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

Here are links to the labeled data for [vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip) and [non-vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip) examples to train your classifier.  These example images come from a combination of the [GTI vehicle image database](http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html), the [KITTI vision benchmark suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/), and examples extracted from the project video itself.   You are welcome and encouraged to take advantage of the recently released [Udacity labeled dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations) to augment your training data.

### Project Writeup

#### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

![sample car][https://github.com/tranlyvu/autonomous-vehicle-projects/tree/master/Vehicle%20Detection/output_images/sample_car_img.jpg]

![sample non car][https://github.com/tranlyvu/autonomous-vehicle-projects/tree/master/Vehicle%20Detection/output_images/sample_non_car_img.jpg]

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

 HOG parameters of `orientations=9`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

![sample hog][https://github.com/tranlyvu/autonomous-vehicle-projects/tree/master/Vehicle%20Detection/output_images/sample_car_hog.jpg]

I tried various combinations of parameters with trials and errors, I finaly chose to use spatial binning, color histogram  and hog features with the following parameters

```
color space : 'YCrCb' 
the number of orientation bins:  9 
pix_per_cell = 8 
cell_per_block = 2 
hog_channel = "ALL" 
spatial_size = (16, 16) 
hist_bins = 16   
```

I trained a linear SVM using the above features and parameters. 

I initially used RGB for color space but 'YCrCb' yielded better result. Number of orientation bins is 9 as it is recommended by original HOG paper. SVM was first recommended by udacity and actually provided good result so i did not tried other models.

The final test accuracy was 0.98%

### Sliding Window Search

I decided to search random window positions at random scales all over the image and came up with this (ok just kidding I didn't actually ;):

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:

### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
